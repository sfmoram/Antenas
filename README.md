# Microwaves and Antennas

The aim of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles and applications of key components in electronic communications, including transmission lines, waveguides, power combiners, filters, and antennas. Students will learn to design, analyze, and optimize these elements in a variety of communication systems. The course seeks to marry a robust theoretical foundation with practical skills, allowing students to understand and apply these principles in their future academic and professional pursuits. An emphasis will be placed on the integration of antennas with these systems, to highlight their interdependence and joint influence on overall system performance.

## Class 01: Transmission Lines: Circuit Model, Propagation Constant, Characteristic Impedance, Reflection Coefficient, VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio).
